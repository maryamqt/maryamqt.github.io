<h2>About me:</h2>
<p>Welcome to my page!</p> 

<p> This is going to be treated as a CV and a little blerb on who I am, and what I do. My name is Maryam (student number - 217318684), that much is clear. I'm  in my last year of my degree (studying IT @ YU). I'm a passionate artist, despite my technical background. I have worked with various companies as interns, gaining valuable skills along the way.</p>

<p>As a young, Muslim Canadian, I find it hard to find my identity in my own program. That is why I chose to study UX/UI design, and aspire to pursue this field full time once I graduate. The above photos are my current moodboard for the week. My moodboards are photos that I find aesthetic, and I try to mimic their colour palletes in my projects. This weeks feeling is warm; so coffee colours, and greens.</p>
